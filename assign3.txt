The Fibonacci series of numbers start with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
where values at position 0 and 1 are 1, and values at each position after
that are a sum of previous two positions.

Using test driven development, write three implementations of a function
to compute the Fibonacci number at a given position.

Start with one implementation at a time rather than rushing through all
of them at the same time.

The three implementations are described below:

1. A simple iteration. 
  Given a position n, loop through totaling values until you reach the value for the given position.

2. A simple recursion.
  Given a position, compute the value at a position using the expression fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).

3. A memoized recursion.
  Given a position, look up to see if the value has been precomputed and if so return that value. Otherwise, use recursion to compute the value.
  
Write a test that confirms that the memoized version is faster than the recursive version.

Reuse as much code as possible.
